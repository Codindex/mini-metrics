# Kubernetes Light Traffic Monitoring - Metrics Service

The Metrics Service is a core component of the Light Traffic Monitoring project. It handles various calculations, including:

- Counting vehicles during specified time intervals.
- Capturing license plates from a camera service at a given time.
- Calculating the optimal route using data from the Intersection and Routes service.

## Features

- Traffic Data Analysis: Calculates metrics such as vehicle count and optimal route suggestions.
- Database Integration: MySQL backend for storing and querying traffic data and formulas.
- Dynamic Visualizations: Graphical representation of applied formulas.
- Authentication: User-based authentication and session management.
- Customizable Formulas: Build and use custom or predefined formulas for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Next.js (v13 or higher)
- Python (with venv support)
- Docker and Minikube
- MySQL database

Additionally, install the required libraries:

- react-hook-form
- zod and @hookform/resolvers/zod
- chart.js and react-chartjs-2

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

We created a virtual environment with: py -m venv .venv
Link Mysql and prisma using Python: https://prisma-client-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

### DATABASE MySQL

1. Create the Database Schema by setting up a MySQL database schema named db_metrics

2. Create the Tables within the schema, name them user, hour, and formula.

3. Configure Environment Variables by updating the .env file with the following values:

- Database name
- Username
- Password
- Connection name
- Port
- Schema name

4. Test API Routes:
   Use Postman to test the API routes by sending a POST request to localhost:3000/api/formula to populate the database with dummy data, including a formula value and its creation date and time.

5. Set Up MySQL Credentials in Kubernetes by creating a mysql_credentials.yaml file. Apply it to the cluster during installation using the following command:
   helm install mycluster mysql-operator/mysql-innodbcluster --set tls.useSelfSigned=true --values mysql_credentials.yaml

6. Verify Credentials by running the following command:
   helm get manifest mycluster

7. Create a new user named Api in the MySQL cluster mycluster, and grant this user the necessary privileges to access and manipulate the database.

8. Deploy a Secret URL in Kubernetes by creating a secret URL and deploying it to your Kubernetes cluster.

9. Deployment Overview:
   At this point, you should have the following components deployed:

- MySQL Operator
- MySQL cluster
- The database schema and tables

10. Build an image of your app
    `& minikube -p minikube docker-env --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression`
    `docker build -t mini-metrics-image .`

11. Perform Prisma migration

- Add a db schema on kubernetes cluster with the same name that is used on local tests
- Modify your environment variable to point your kubernetes mysql cluster
- `prisma migrate deploy`

12. Run the image of your app

- kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
- kubectl apply -f service.yaml
- kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

### Frontend in Typescript

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mini-metrics-frontend.git
   cd mini-metrics-frontend
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Run the development server:
   npm run dev
4. Visit the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Key Components

1. Login Page (src/app/Login/page.tsx)
   Handles user authentication using form validation with react-hook-form and zod.
   Redirects authenticated users to the Formulas dashboard.
2. Signup Page (src/app/Signup/page.tsx)
   Enables new user registration with validation for username, email, and password.
   Redirects successfully registered users to the Login page.
3. Formulas Page (src/app/Formulas/page.tsx)
   Allows users to build and apply formulas.
   Displays real-time graphs using chart.js based on the applied formulas.
   Provides options to add or clear formulas.

## Usage

1. Authentication:
   Navigate to the Login page.
   Use your credentials to log in or sign up for a new account.

2. Manage Formulas:
   Once authenticated, access the Formulas page.
   Create a new formula or use a predefined one.
   Apply formulas to visualize data on the graph.

3. Customization:
   Modify the formulas array in the Formulas page to add new default formulas.

## Dependencies

react-hook-form: For form validation and handling.
zod: Schema validation for forms.
chart.js: For rendering dynamic graphs.
react-chartjs-2: React wrapper for Chart.js.
